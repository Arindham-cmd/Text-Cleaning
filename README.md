# Text-Cleaning

I have choosen Bubmle Application Reviews as my task. Here, I have showcased step by step process that is involved for textual data analysis. 

The steps are to first take the textiual data from column and make it into a list so that you can see all the nexessary things that has to be changes and observed.
After that you start the processing work, like make the sentences into a lower case. Then remove special charachters,emojis and punctuations. Then remove the stop words post doing that do the tokenization and then stemming or lemmatization. 

Then for analysis you can go ahead with ngram or can build a word cloud depending on the need.
